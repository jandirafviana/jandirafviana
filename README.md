### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jandira, I'm from Brazil and I'm studying Information Systems. 
I've been working with technology for almost ten years, but my journey in the dev world has started recently.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and CyPress;
- ðŸ’» Here is where I keep my [Python Exercises repository](https://github.com/jandirafviana/python-exercises);
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Python and Software Testing Tools :);
- ðŸŽ® Gaming is my passion;
- ðŸ’¼ Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-viana-/);

Every day I'm learning something new and I don't have any projects at the moment, but in the meanwhile I share my learnings here :)
