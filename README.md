### Welcome! 👋

My name is Jandira, I'm from Brazil and I'm studying Information Systems. 
I've been working with technology for almost ten years, but my journey in the dev world has started recently.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and CyPress;
- 💻 Here is where I keep my [Python Exercises repository](https://github.com/jandirafviana/python-exercises);
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Python and Software Testing Tools;
- 🎮 Gaming is my passion;
- 💼 Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-viana-/);
- ✔️ Scrum Foundation Professional Certificate;
- ✔️ TOEFL ITP Certificate (Test of English as a Foreign Language);

Every day I'm learning something new and I don't have any projects at the moment, but in the meanwhile I share my learnings here! :)
